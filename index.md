### About Me
{: .archive__subtitle}

Hi, my name's Chen Zhang and I'm currently a lecturer at School of Computer Science & Technology in Soochow University.
I received my Ph.D. from Fudan University in 2022, supervised by Prof. [Xin Peng](https://cspengxin.github.io/) and Prof. [Bihuan](https://chenbihuan.github.io/). 
I received my M.Sc. from China University of Mining and Technology in 2016, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://siee.cumt.edu.cn/info/1012/1016.htm">Dunwei Gong</a>.
My research focuses on intelligent software development, software evolution, software testing and continuous integration.
